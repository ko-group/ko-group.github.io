Our group is looking for motivated **Ph.D. students** in computational condensed-phase chemistry (funded via Teaching and Research Assistantships).

Incoming graduate students will apply our recently developed [SeA technique](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00827) in conjunction with machine learning to study reactive processes in solutions and at interfaces relevant to energy, materials, and environmental sciences.

In addition to computational condensed-phase chemistry, our group also has strength in high-performance computing (using emerging parallel computing architectures ranging from leadership supercomputers with >10,000 CPUs to GPU accelerators) as well as modern software development and operations (DevOps).

By combining rigorous scientific research and software development experience, we aim to prepare trainees for career success in industry, academia, and government labs.

We encourage interested applicants to contact [Hsin-Yu](mailto:hsin-yu.ko@unt.edu) and check out [our documentation page for prospective students](https://public.docs.ko-research.org/outreach/prospective-students/).
